                        </header>

                        <p>
                            Trust is a concept most companies tout as one of their core values.
                            The word "trust" sounds good at the annual employee retreat, it looks great on a plaque,
                            and it seems like a no-brainer when you read it on the back of a brochure. But in reality,
                            it’s often just a buzzword.
                            Oh sure, leaders nod in professional approval when they hear it,
                            but then they go right out and behave in a manner that makes everybody mistrust the manager.
                            Business owners will often say, “trust is established with behavioral consistency.”
                            In other words, if you behaved appropriately yesterday and today,
                            then I’ll trust you to behave appropriately tomorrow.
                            The truth is consistency of behaviors only works for creating a culture
                            filled with trust when it’s a behavior you desire, and even then,
                            some consistent behaviors still won’t get you there.
                            For example, someone may be consistently charismatic yet unreliable -- hence not leading to trust.
                            Even worse, what if two of your team members behaved obnoxiously or inappropriately yesterday and today?
                            In fact, what if they were downright jerks yesterday and today?
                            Then I only trust they’ll be jerks tomorrow too, which means I don’t actually trust them.
                            Predictive behavior is not how you establish trust across your company’s culture.
