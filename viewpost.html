                        <h2>4 Behaviors Leaders Must Model to Build a Culture of Trust</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Trust is a concept most companies tout as one of their core values.
                        The word "trust" sounds good at the annual employee retreat, it looks great on a plaque,
                        and it seems like a no-brainer when you read it on the back of a brochure. But in reality,
                        it’s often just a buzzword.
                        Oh sure, leaders nod in professional approval when they hear it,
                        but then they go right out and behave in a manner that makes everybody mistrust the manager.
                        Business owners will often say, “trust is established with behavioral consistency.”
                        In other words, if you behaved appropriately yesterday and today,
                        then I’ll trust you to behave appropriately tomorrow.
                        The truth is consistency of behaviors only works for creating a culture
                        filled with trust when it’s a behavior you desire, and even then,
                        some consistent behaviors still won’t get you there.
                        For example, someone may be consistently charismatic yet unreliable -- hence not leading to trust.
                        Even worse, what if two of your team members behaved obnoxiously or inappropriately yesterday and today?
                        In fact, what if they were downright jerks yesterday and today?
                        Then I only trust they’ll be jerks tomorrow too, which means I don’t actually trust them.
                        Predictive behavior is not how you establish trust across your company’s culture.
                        Trust requires four specific behaviors. These behaviors, not surprisingly,
                        are related to emotional intelligence and interpersonal communication, and they’re all about vulnerability.
                        Establishing vulnerability-based trust requires:
                        1. Asking for and accepting help.
                        Asking for help isn’t always easy, especially for go-getters who possess talent in multiple arenas.
                        But the world is vast, information is coming at us rapidly, and you can’t be brilliant at everything.
                        Stop trying to be a know-it-all, and instead, become highly skilled in a few domain areas that light you up.
                        Maintaining domain expertise is a valued commodity, and when you combine your smarts with others’ areas of expertise,
                        you collectively generate stellar outcomes that most often cannot be achieved alone.
                        Being able to contribute in an appreciated and valued manner builds trust fast.
                        And asking isn’t the whole equation -- but nice try.
                        Once the person you asked for help agrees to lend you their support, you must accept their offer.
                        Nothing like being dismissed or uninvited to hinder trust.
                        Question hack: How safe is it for people to ask for help in your organization? And how might it get safer?
                        2. Offering help and expertise without judgment.
                        Larry from marketing just stepped into your office.
                        He needs help planning for his department’s quarterly budget. You sigh.
                        For such a brilliant guy, why can’t he understand numbers? You pull out your pen,
                        channel your best condescending tone and begin to walk him through it again.
                        “As I said last quarter ...”  Wow! Oh-so-not-helpful. Now Larry is embarrassed, and he hates your guts.
                        Remember that everyone has a role to play, everyone is hired to solve different problems.
                        When we respect one another’s diverse talents, we build trust.
